# Overview

The QGIS EcoValuator provides a simple means of estimating the dollar value of ecosystem services, such as for recreation, water supply, food, and others.  

In the first step (estimate_ecosystem_service_values_for_study_region.py), the EcoValuator clips and attaches raster data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to a user-supplied polygon or polygon layer and attaches a set of per-unit-area values based on the land cover type of each pixel. Output from this step includes a new raster including just the clipped data and a table of aggregate ecosystem service values (in dollars per year) for each land cover-and-ecosystem service combination.

In the second step (map_the_value_of_individual_ecosystem_services.py), the EcoValuator generates a raster for a chosen ecosystem service so that users can view the spatial variation in that serviceâ€™s value across the study region. By repeating this step for other ecosystem services, the user can create a series of maps of different values that can be layered or stacked to show combined value for multiple services.

In the third step (create_print_layout.py), which is optional, users can choose to use raster output from step 2 and automatically generate a print layout as a .pdf document. This step takes one raster layer as input. The .pdf will show the current extent at which users are viewing the map and a legend with all active map layers.
